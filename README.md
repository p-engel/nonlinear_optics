# Use cases
## Terahertz conversion effeciency
Using a quasi-3D theoretical model, taking into account cascaded optical
rectification, three-photon absorption (3PA) of the near-infrared
radiation, and material dispersion/absorption properties, we describe the
Terahertz (THz) generation through optical rectification of near-infrared
femtosecond pulses in DSTMS.

## Geometric dependence of higher-order susceptibility tensors.
We characterize the geometric dependence of the second and third order
suseptibility tensors of metasurfaces made from centrosymmetric and epsilon
near-zero (ENZ) materials, and describe their crystal class.
