# Use cases
## Terahertz conversion effeciency
First we model the Terahertz(THz) generation through opticalrectification (OR) 
ofnear-infrared femtosecond pulses in DSTMS using a quasi-3D theoretical model,
which takes into account cascaded OR, three-photon absorption (3PA) of the
near-infrared radiation, and material dispersion/absorption properties.

## Geometric dependence of higher-order susceptibility tensors.
Second: we characterize the geometric dependence of the second and third order
suseptibility tensors of metasurfaces made from centrosymmetric and epsilon
near-zero (ENZ) materials, and describe their crystal class.
